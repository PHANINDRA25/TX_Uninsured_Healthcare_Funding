# TX_Uninsured_Healthcare_Funding
Welcome to the TX_Uninsured_Healthcare_Funding repository. Here I am taking up the role of Healthcare Policy Analyst to decide where to direct state funds to help finance health-care costs in Texas. I have considered two parameters- uninsured population % and poverty indicators like the unemployment rate in each of the counties in Texas to decide where the funds need to be concentrated.I have used ArcGIS for this project and have performed the following tasks :

1. Developed a choropleth map with custom intervals to visually pinpoint counties with elevated uninsured populations.

2. Integrated a point map with customized bins displaying unemployment rates onto the uninsured choropleth map, facilitating the analysis of the correlation between unemployment rates and the uninsured population.

3. Developed a scatter plot to visually represent the relationship.

## Conclusions 
Identified the counties in Texas that require greater healthcare funding to better service uninsured people. 
It was found that the uninsured population and unemployment rates share a positive correlation. Hence government and policy makers can bring out policies that help people get employed.
